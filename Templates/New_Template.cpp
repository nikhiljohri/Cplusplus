/*
To have a template declaration in header file and implementation in cpp file 
1. Have an object creation and implementation in same cpp file.
2. Have an inline function implementation in header file itself
3. Have an object creation in one cpp file and import this cpp file in another cpp file where you are planning to implement it.
4. Have an object creation in one cpp file and implentation in another file but include file with implementaion in header file.
